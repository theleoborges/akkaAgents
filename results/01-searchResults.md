The GitHub Next team conducted research using a combination of surveys and experiments, which led us to expected and unexpected answers. Eirini Kalliamvakou·@ikaliam September 7, 2022 | Updated May 21, 2024 | 8 minutes Share: Everyday, we use tools and form habits to achieve more with less. Software development produces such a high number of tools and technologies to make work efficient, to the point of inducing decision fatigue. When we first launched a technical preview of GitHub Copilot in 2021, our hypothesis was that it would improve developer productivity and, in fact, early users shared reports that it did. In the months following its release, we wanted to better understand and measure its effects with quantitative and qualitative research. To do that, we first had to grapple with the question: what does it mean to be productive? Why is developer productivity so difficult to measure? When it comes to measuring developer productivity, there is little consensus and there are far more questions than answers. For example: What are the “right” productivity metrics? [1, 2] How valuable are self-reports of productivity? [3] Is the traditional view of productivity—outputs over inputs—a good fit for the complex problem solving and creativity involved in development work? [4]. In a 2021 study, we found that developers’ own view of productivity has a twist–it’s more akin to having a good day. The ability to stay focused on the task at hand, make meaningful progress, and feel good at the end of a day’s work make a real difference in developers’ satisfaction and productivity. This isn’t a one-off finding, either. Other academic research shows that these outcomes are important for developers [5] and that satisfied developers perform better [6, 7]. Clearly, there’s more to developer productivity than inputs and outputs. How do we think about developer productivity at GitHub? Because AI-assisted development is a relatively new field, as researchers we have little prior research to draw upon. We wanted to measure GitHub Copilot’s effects, but what are they? After early observations and interviews with users, we surveyed more than 2,000 developers to learn at scale about their experience using GitHub Copilot. We designed our research approach with three points in mind: Look at productivity holistically. At GitHub we like to think broadly and sustainably about developer productivity and the many factors that influence it. We used the SPACE productivity framework to pick which aspects to investigate. Include developers’ first-hand perspective. We conducted multiple rounds of research including qualitative (perceptual) and quantitative (observed) data to assemble the full picture. We wanted to verify: (a) Do users’ actual experiences confirm what we infer from telemetry? (b) Does our qualitative feedback generalize to our large user base? Assess GitHub Copilot’s effects in everyday development scenarios. When setting up our studies, we took extra care to recruit professional developers, and to design tests around typical tasks a developer might work through in a given day. Let’s dig in and see what we found! Finding 1: Developer productivity goes beyond speed Through a large-scale survey, we wanted to see if developers using GitHub Copilot see benefits in other areas beyond speeding up tasks. Here’s what stood out: Improving developer satisfaction. Between 60–75% of users reported they feel more fulfilled with their job, feel less frustrated when coding, and are able to focus on more satisfying work when using GitHub Copilot. That’s a win for developers feeling good about what they do! Conserving mental energy. Developers reported that GitHub Copilot helped them stay in the flow (73%) and preserve mental effort during repetitive tasks (87%). That’s developer happiness right there, since we know from previous research that context switches and interruptions can ruin a developer’s day, and that certain types of work are draining [8, 9]. What the charts show, and how to read them 📝 Helpful context: In the survey, we included statements that covered all dimensions of the SPACE framework. SPACE is the acronym for a multidimensional framework that describes several aspects of developer productivity: (1) Satisfaction and well-being; (2) Performance; (3) Activity; (4) Communication and collaboration; and (5) Efficiency and flow. In this post, we focus on the results from the dimensions of “Satisfaction and well-being” and “Efficiency and flow.” Both dimensions are critical to developer productivity and are often overlooked. We’re also preparing more publications of our findings and data, so we can’t share everything today! 📊 What the charts show: The charts below show the percentage of respondents who agreed with the corresponding statement (strongly agree + agree). The >2,000 responses we received came from developers that were signed up in the Technical Preview. They were primarily professional developers (~60%), though we also received responses from students (~30%), and developers who identified as hobbyists (~7%). If you want a refresher on how we also correlated the productivity results to how much developers use GitHub Copilot, check out our previous blog post, and our academic paper. Table: Survey responses measuring dimensions of developer productivity when using GitHub Copilot All questions were modeled off of the SPACE framework. Developers see GitHub Copilot as a productivity aid, but there’s more to it than that. One user described the overall experience: (With Copilot) I have to think less, and when I have to think it’s the fun stuff. It sets off a little spark that makes coding more fun and more efficient. - Senior Software Engineer The takeaway from our qualitative investigation was that letting GitHub Copilot shoulder the boring and repetitive work of development reduced cognitive load. This makes room for developers to enjoy the more meaningful work that requires complex, critical thinking and problem solving, leading to greater happiness and satisfaction. Finding 2: … but speed is important, too In the survey, we saw that developers reported they complete tasks faster when using GitHub Copilot, especially repetitive ones. That was an expected finding (GitHub Copilot writes faster than a human, after all), but >90% agreement was still a pleasant surprise. Developers overwhelmingly perceive that GitHub Copilot is helping them complete tasks faster—can we observe and measure that effect in practice? For that we conducted a controlled experiment. Figure: Summary of the experiment process and results We recruited 95 professional developers, split them randomly into two groups, and timed how long it took them to write an HTTP server in JavaScript. One group used GitHub Copilot to complete the task, and the other one didn’t. We tried to control as many factors as we could–all developers were already familiar with JavaScript, we gave everyone the same instructions, and we leveraged GitHub Classroom to automatically score submissions for correctness and completeness with a test suite. We’re sharing a behind-the-scenes blog post soon about how we set up our experiment! In the experiment, we measured—on average—how successful each group was in completing the task and how long each group took to finish. The group that used GitHub Copilot had a higher rate of completing the task (78%, compared to 70% in the group without Copilot). The striking difference was that developers who used GitHub Copilot completed the task significantly faster–55% faster than the developers who didn’t use GitHub Copilot. Specifically, the developers using GitHub Copilot took on average 1 hour and 11 minutes to complete the task, while the developers who didn’t use GitHub Copilot took on average 2 hours and 41 minutes. These results are statistically significant (P=.0017) and the 95% confidence interval for the percentage speed gain is [21%, 89%]. There’s more to uncover! We’re conducting more experiments and a more thorough analysis of the experiment data we already collected—looking into heterogeneous effects, or potential effects on the quality of code—and we are planning further academic publications to share our findings. What do these findings mean for developers? We’re here to support developers while they build software—that includes working more efficiently and finding more satisfaction in their work. In our research, we saw that GitHub Copilot supports faster completion times, conserves developers’ mental energy, helps them focus on more satisfying work, and ultimately find more fun in the coding they do. We’re also hearing that these benefits are becoming material to engineering leaders in companies that ran early trials with GitHub Copilot. When they consider how to keep their engineers healthy and productive, they are thinking through the same lens of holistic developer wellbeing and promoting the use of tools that bring delight. The engineers’ satisfaction with doing edgy things and us giving them edgy tools is a factor for me. Copilot makes things more exciting. - CTO, Large Engineering Org With the advent of GitHub Copilot, we’re not alone in exploring the impact of AI-powered code completion tools! In the realm of productivity, we recently saw an evaluation with 24 students, and Google’s internal assessment of ML-enhanced code completion. More broadly, the research community is trying to understand GitHub Copilot’s implications in a number of contexts: education, security, labor market, as well as developer practices and behaviors. We are all currently learning by trying GitHub Copilot in a variety of settings. This is an evolving field, and we’re excited for the findings that the research community — including us — will uncover in the months to come. Acknowledgements We are very grateful to all the developers who participated in the survey and experiments–we would be in the dark without your input! GitHub Next conducted the experiment in partnership with the Microsoft Office of the Chief Economist, and specifically in collaboration with Sida Peng and Aadharsh Kannan.

The research found that the increase in developer productivity due to AI could boost global GDP by over $1.5 trillion. Thomas Dohmke·@ashtom June 27, 2023 | Updated May 14, 2024 | 8 minutes Share: Almost one year ago, we launched GitHub Copilot to the world. At the time, it felt like a leap into the unknown: We were introducing the first at-scale AI pair programmer to the world’s developers, and were cautiously optimistic. But now I am overwhelmingly confident in the promise of this technology. One year later, we have witnessed a sea change in software development. Today, GitHub Copilot has been activated by more than one million developers and adopted by over 20,000 organizations. It has generated over three billion accepted lines of code, and is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool. From productivity analysis to developer happiness, we have been collecting research and data on GitHub Copilot that will help us continue to improve and adapt our models. As we have recently passed the one-year anniversary of GitHub Copilot’s launch, I’m sharing key insights we’ve discovered along the way, and breaking research released today that includes the economic impact of the AI-powered developer lifecycle. Let’s dive in. Want to learn more? These findings come from research we conducted with the analyst firm Keystone.AI and Harvard Business School professor Marco Iansiti. Our goal? To explore the immediate and long-term impact generative AI will have on developer productivity, the global economy and the open source ecosystem. Get the research Generative AI signals a sea change in software development GitHub Copilot is turbocharging developer productivity. Analysis on a large sample of GitHub Copilot users (n = 934,533) reveals a sizable productivity impact. On average, within the first year in the market, users accept nearly 30% of code suggestions from GitHub Copilot and report increased productivity from these acceptances. Furthermore, we found that over time, the acceptance rate steadily increased as developers became more familiar with the tool. This suggests that GitHub Copilot has a large runway to continue its impact on developer productivity, as users become more accustomed to developing software with it. This figure shows the acceptance rate of GitHub Copilot recommendations over time. AI developer productivity benefits could boost global GDP by over $1.5 trillion. Using 30% productivity enhancement, with a projected number of 45 million professional developers in 2030, generative AI developer tools could add productivity gains of an additional 15 million “effective developers” to worldwide capacity by 2030. This could boost global GDP by over $1.5 trillion, a boon to economic activity generated by this one group of workers. We know that the demand for software and developers will likely increase—as it has throughout the history of developer tools–and these productivity gains will continue to trigger an enormous impact, as developers seize new opportunities to utilize AI for solutions design and accelerate digital transformation worldwide. AI-powered developer tools could benefit global GDP by as much as $1.5 trillion with the productivity gains of “15 million” effective developers. Less experienced developers benefit more from GitHub Copilot. Our study also found that less experienced developers have a greater advantage with tools like GitHub Copilot, which is corroborated by other studies, including our own previous experiments on the impact of AI on developer productivity. As developers use these tools to upskill, they will become more fluent in prompting and interacting with AI to power the development lifecycle. This will ultimately help democratize software development for more people, help close the labor gap, and establish AI pair programming tools as part of the standard developer education experience. This figure shows that developers with less experience benefit relatively more than more experienced developers. GitHub is the engineering system for the age of AI. We also observed an explosion of open source innovation on GitHub. According to our ecosystem analysis of AI repositories on GitHub, the landscape that makes up those working on generative AI is diverse, from big tech companies to individuals. And open source activity around generative AI projects, based on our analysis of GitHub repositories and commits, has increased exponentially. We expect open source developers on GitHub to drive the next wave of AI innovation. This figure shows the monthly growth in the number of commits in generative AI repositories on GitHub. Faster, happier developers Previous research examined not only the acceptance rate, but the speed at which developers completed tasks with GitHub Copilot. For example, we found in a quantitative research study that developers completed tasks 55% faster with GitHub Copilot. Moreover, our early research found that 46% of code was completed by GitHub Copilot in those files where it was enabled. These are impressive figures, but productivity for productivity’s sake means nothing—we built GitHub Copilot for the sake of developer happiness. This is GitHub Copilot’s inherent purpose. And it’s been a success in that regard, too. In one survey, 75% of developers said they felt more fulfilled when using GitHub Copilot. In another survey, developers said the top benefit of AI coding tools was improving their coding language skills, which developers also said can lead to a more positive workday. More productive, more satisfied, and more capable developers—that’s exactly what GitHub Copilot is all about. Top-level findings that show GitHub Copilot helps developers code faster, completes up to 46% of code, and leaves developers feeling more fulfilled at work. Our impact with GitHub Copilot for Business The economic impact of generative AI over the next decade will be profound—and we’re already seeing large-scale adoption of AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot by developers and companies. In a recent survey, 92% of developers said they use AI tools both in and outside of work, which underscores how quickly these tools are redefining the overall developer experience. We launched GitHub Copilot for Business earlier this year to bring the power of generative AI to organizations of all sizes, regardless of whether they use GitHub to build software. Three months later, more than 10,000 companies were already using it—and today, more than 20,000 organizations are using GitHub Copilot for Business. More than 20,000 organizations are using Copilot for Business to accelerate their developers’ progress. And companies that use GitHub Copilot are seeing real results. Engineering teams at Duolingo, for instance, have used GitHub Copilot for Business to achieve a 25% increase in developer velocity. “With GitHub Copilot, our developers stay in the flow state and keep momentum instead of clawing through code libraries or documentation,” says Johnathan Burket, a senior engineering manager at Duolingo. Apart from this, we are increasingly seeing organizations require their applicants to test for software development jobs with GitHub Copilot, suggesting that AI pair programming will become a standard tool for testing applicants. This means that learning how to use generative AI tools will soon become a core competency of a software developer. An inextricable link What we draw from all this is that generative AI is turbocharging developer productivity with gains that will ultimately drive a boom in GDP for the global economy and, in turn, a surge in demand for software developers. We’ve seen this throughout the history of developer tool innovations from compilers to open source, and we’re already seeing that again with GitHub Copilot and soon GitHub Copilot X. One year later, we’ve realized this collision of AI and the software developer will not lead to a decrease in developer jobs—it will lead to AI augmenting developer potential and accelerating human progress. As more developers adopt generative AI tools and become fluent in the skill set of prompting with a copilot, it is clear that this new way of software development has created an inextricable link between humankind and artificial intelligence that could well define how the world’s software is built for generations to come. And the world will be all the better for it. Learn more about the economic impact of generative AI Get our latest research with Keystone.AI into the economic impact of generative AI.

[2302.06590] The Impact of AI on Developer Productivity: Evidence from GitHub Copilot The Impact of AI on Developer Productivity: Evidence from GitHub Copilot Sida Peng,1∗ Eirini Kalliamvakou,2 Peter Cihon,2 Mert Demirer3 1Microsoft Research, 14820 NE 36th St, Redmond, USA 2GitHub Inc., 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco, USA 3MIT Sloan School of Management, 100 Main Street Cambridge, USA ∗To whom correspondence should be addressed; E-mail: sidpeng@microsoft.com Abstract Generative AI tools hold promise to increase human productivity. This paper presents results from a controlled experiment with GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer. Recruited software developers were asked to implement an HTTP server in JavaScript as quickly as possible. The treatment group, with access to the AI pair programmer, completed the task 55.8% faster than the control group. Observed heterogenous effects show promise for AI pair programmers to help people transition into software development careers. Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) applications hold promise to increase human productivity. A variety of AI models have demonstrated human-level capabilities in fields ranging from natural language understanding to image recognition [Zhang et al., 2022]. As these systems are deployed in the real-world, how do they change labor productivity? While there is a growing literature studying perceptions of AI tools, how people use them, and their implications for security and education [Nguyen and Nadi, 2022, Barke et al., 2022, Finnie-Ansley et al., 2022, Sandoval et al., 2022] there has been little research on productivity impacts of AI-powered tools in professional contexts, cf. [Mozannar et al., 2022, Vaithilingam et al., 2022, Ziegler et al., 2022]. The potential productivity impacts of AI have major implications for the labor market and firms, including changes in employment, skills, and firm organization [Raj and Seamans, 2018, Agrawal et al., 2019]. This paper studies the productivity effects of AI tools on software development. We present a controlled trial of GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer that suggests code and entire functions in real time based on context. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI’s generative AI model, Codex [Chen et al., 2021]. In the trial, programmers were tasked and incentivized to implement an HTTP server in JavaScript as quickly as possible. The treated group had access to GitHub Copilot and watched a brief video explaining how to use the tool. The control group did not have access to GitHub Copilot but was otherwise unconstrained, i.e., they were free to use internet search and Stack Overflow to complete the task. The performance difference between treated and control groups are statistically and practically significant: the treated group completed the task 55.8% faster (95% confidence interval: 21-89%). Developers with less programming experience, older programmers, and those who program more hours per day benefited the most. These heterogeneous effects point towards promise for AI-pair programmers in support of expanding access to careers in software development. The paper proceeds as follows. We first describe the design of the controlled trial and provide summary statistics. We then present the results. We conclude by a discussion on implications of the study for productivity research on AI-powered tools, its limitations, and future research directions on the broader economic impacts of AI-driven productivity. Study Design We conducted a controlled experiment to measure the productivity impact of using GitHub Copilot in programming tasks. The experiment began on May 15, 2022 and ended on June 20, 2022, right before GitHub Copilot became generally available. We recruited 95 professional programmers through Upwork, a freelancing platform. Participation in the experiment was advertised on Upwork as a job posting, looking to recruit freelancer developers. Figures 1 and 2 show (respectively) the job posting and the contract that was sent to participants to sign, in accordance with Upwork’s policies. Once participants signed the contract, they were randomly split into control and treatment groups. Figure 3 shows the instructions sent to each group through email. The treated group was instructed to watch a 1-minute video introducing them to GitHub Copilot. In addition to the instructions, they also received an automated email with installation instructions for GitHub Copilot once granted access to the tool. We verify from telemetry after the experiment that all participants from the treated group have configured GitHub Copilot and accepted recommendations other than five who did not finish the sign up and thus started the experiment without the GitHub Copilot. Both treated and control groups were instructed to complete an entry survey to provide demographic information such as age, gender, location, and educational background. Before we began recruitment, we received approval for the study from the Microsoft Research Ethics Review Board. Participants were instructed to write an HTTP server in JavaScript—the treatment group would use GitHub Copilot to complete the task, while the control group would not. Besides the use of GitHub Copilot in the treated group, participants were unconstrained in their software development —they could use any sources of information as they normally do, such as internet search and Stack Overflow. We calculated two metrics as a measure of performance for each group: task success and task completion time. Task success was measured as the percentage of participants in a group that adequately completed the task. Task completion time was measured as the time from start to end of the task. Using a standardized task provides us with precise measures of performance as it is difficult to measure productivity of software developers. To administer the task, we used GitHub Classroom, a platform for teachers to issue and grade coding assignments. In this way, we accurately measured the timing and completion for each participant. The instructions gave participants a link to a particular GitHub Classroom instance with a single assignment referencing a template repository. When joining the assignment, participants received a personal copy of the template repository, with the task description (shown in Figure 4) and a skeleton codebase for participants to build upon. The creation date and time of that personal copy created a timestamp. Each participant’s repository was private to them and visible to the researchers conducting the experiment—but not to other participants. We included a test suite in the repository, comprising twelve checks for submission correctness. If a submission passes, all twelve tests we counted are successfully completed. Participants could see the tests but were unable to alter them. When participants committed and pushed their changes to GitHub, GitHub Classroom ran the test suite on their submission and reported the number of passing tests. Participants could push as often as they pleased, automatically logging a timestamp each time. The time elapsed between the timestamp of repository creation and the timestamp of the first commit to successfully pass all 12 tests was counted as the participant’s task completion time. The full history of test suite runs is visible on each repository, enabling researchers to observe partial results for participants that did not fully complete the task. The participants’ final compensation is calculated based on their time to completion and the scale we had previously shared with them (shown in Figure 1). After participants had completed the task, we sent them the link to an exit survey. We asked the treatment group how helpful they found GitHub Copilot as they worked on the task, as well as asked them to estimate how much faster they completed the task compared to how long this task would have taken them without using GitHub Copilot. We also asked the control group to estimate the size of the speed gain they would have experienced if they used GitHub Copilot, after showing them a 1-minute demo video. Figure 1: Upwork job posting Note: Job posting on Upwork starting May 25th 2022. The posting includes the task description, skill requirements and budget information. Figure 2: Upwork contract Note: The contract sent to participants through Upwork. Upon accepting the contract, participants were randomized into control and treatment groups and given instructions for the task. Figure 3: Instruction email to participants Note: Email instructions sent to participants in the treatment (top) and control (bottom) groups. Figure 4: Participants’ view of the task description Note: The task description participants saw in the index.js file in the repository that was automatically created for them by GitHub Classroom. Results A total of 166 offers were sent during the experiment, and 95 were accepted. The 95 developers were randomly assigned into control and treated groups, with 45 in the treated group and 50 in control. Thirty-five developers from both the treated and control groups completed the task and survey. Figure 5 presents the summary statistics of these participants. Figure 5: Summary statistics of the experiment participants From left to right on each row see the following distributions: Participant age; Number of different languages used in the last 2 years; Level of education; Employment status; Geographical location; Yearly income; Programming experience; Time spent coding daily. Most of the participants are in the age group of 25-34 and come from India and Pakistan. This group of participants is also characterized by relatively lower income (median yearly income between $10,000-$19,000) compared to US standards but high education level (the majority have a 4-year degree and above). The group has an average coding experience of 6 years and, on average, reported spending 9 hours on coding in a working day. Figure 6: Time to task completion Note: Distribution of time to task completion between treated (blue) and control (orange) groups Figure 6 plots the distribution between time to completion between treated and control groups. Conditioning on completing the task, the average completion time from the treated group is 71.17 minutes and 160.89 minutes for the control group. This represents a 55.8% reduction in completion time. The p-value for the t-test is 0.0017, and a 95% confidence interval for the improvement is between [21%, 89%]. There are four outliers with time to completion above 300 min. All outliers are in the control group, however our results remain robust if these outliers are dropped. This result suggests that Copilot increases average productivity significantly in our experiment population. We also find that the treated group’s success rate is 7 percentage points higher than the control group, but the estimate is not statistically significant, with a 95% confidence interval of [-0.11, 0.25]. We then investigate whether this effect is heterogeneous across different dimensions including experience, employment status, income, education and software language preference. We assume the treatment effect is a linear function of the covariates of interest. We apply Horvitz-Thomson transformation in [Athey and Imbens, 2015] (see also [Banerjee and Duflo, 2003] and [Carneiro et al., 2011])) and then regress the transformed outcome of interest on observables. The estimates in Table 1 report coefficients from this regression. The results show that less experienced developers (years of professional coding), developers with heavy coding load (hours of coding per day), and older developers (developers aged between 25 and 44) benefit more from Copilot. Figure 7: Self-estimated productivity gain Note: This graph shows the distribution of the estimated productivity improvement when using Copilot. Blue represents the estimation from the treated group and orange represents the estimation from the control group. Table 1: Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Estimates SE t-Stat p-Value (Intercept) 78.01 67.84 1.15 0.2552 Programming experience (years) 8.23 4.36 1.90 0.0629 Hours of programming per day -11.70 4.74 -2.47 0.0168 Age: 25-44 -74.55 33.52 -2.22 0.0303 Unemployed -35.98 36.33 -0.99 0.3263 Income less than $20,000 0.64 27.47 0.02 0.9814 No college -36.57 32.89 -1.11 0.2711 Language Preference: Java -11.77 33.16 -0.35 0.7240 Language Preference: Python 22.90 42.19 0.54 0.5895 Note: This table presents the heterogeneous treatment effects. The results suggest developer with less programming experience are more likely to benefit from Copilot, similarly for developers with more daily programming hours and in the age group above 25. We conducted an exit survey with two questions to learn about the experience of subjects. First, we asked them to estimate how much productivity gain or loss (in percentage term) Copilot provided to them for completing the task. While the control group was not exposed to Copilot during the task, they were given the tutorial video before answering this question so that they are aware of the features of Copilot. Figure 7 presents the distribution of the self-reported productivity gain estimates from the control and treated groups. On average, participants in both treated and control groups estimated a 35% increase in productivity, which is an underestimation compared with the 55.8% increase in their revealed productivity. In the second question, participants were asked the highest monthly price at which they would be interested in getting notified about the release of GitHub Copilot. The intention is to learn about developers’ willingness to pay for Copilot as the answer to this question provides an upper bound for the developers’ willingness to pay. Figure 8 presents the distribution of the irrelevant price separated for the control and treated groups. The average irrelevant price for the treated group is $27.25, and the average irrelevant price for the control group is $16.91, both per month. The difference is statistically significant at the 95% level. This result provides indirect evidence that treated group benefited from Copilot during their task as their willingness to pay is significantly higher than the control group. Figure 8: Distributing of irrelevant price Note: This graph shows the distribution of the irrelevant price between the treated (blue) and control (orange) groups. Discussion This paper presents evidence on the productivity effects of generative AI tools in software development. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first controlled experiment to measure the productivity of AI tools in professional software development. Our results suggest that Copilot has statistically and practically significant impact on productivity: the treated group that has access to GitHub Copilot was able to complete the task 55.8% faster than the control group. Further investigations into the productivity impacts of AI-powered tools in software development are warranted. This study examines a standardized programming task in an experiment to obtain a precise measure of productivity, instead of a task where developers collaborate on large projects in professional proprietary and/or open-source settings. Productivity benefits may vary across specific tasks and programming languages, so more research is needed to understand how our results generalizes to other tasks. Finally, this study does not examine the effects of AI on code quality. AI assistance can increase code quality if it suggests code better than the programmer writes, or it can reduce quality if the programmer pays less attention to code. The code quality can have performance and security considerations that can change the real-world impact of AI. The heterogeneous effects identified in this study warrant close attention. Our results suggest that less experienced programmers benefit more from Copilot. If this result persists in further studies, the productivity benefits for novice programmers and programmers of older age point to important possibilities for skill initiatives that support job transitions into software development. The economic impacts of these models also warrant further research [Manning et al., 2022], with particular attention on their implications for labor market. In 2021, over 4.6 million people in the United States worked in computer and mathematical occupations,111https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes150000.htm a Bureau of Labor Statistics category that includes computer programmers, data scientists, and statisticians. These workers earned $464.8 billion or roughly 2% of US GDP. If the results of this study were to be extrapolated to the population level, a 55.8% increase in productivity would imply a significant amount of cost savings in the economy and have a notable impact on GDP growth. It is, as of yet, unclear how such gains would be distributed and how job tasks would change to incorporate AI-powered developer tools. It is important to consider such impacts and to begin research on these implications at the outset [Klinova and Korinek, 2021]. References [Agrawal et al., 2019] Agrawal, A., Gans, J.

The team conducted three separate randomized controlled trials (RCT) involving over 4,000 developers; the ones using Copilot achieved a 26% increase in productivity. The three experiments were performed at Microsoft, Accenture, and an "anonymous Fortune 100 electronics manufacturing company." For each of the 4,867 developers in the study, the researchers measured the weekly number of pull requests, commits, and code builds performed. They found that developers using Copilot had an average increase of 26.08% in the number of pull requests completed per week. They also found that productivity varied by developer experience, with less experienced developers getting more benefit from Copilot. According to the research team: Our work complements both the literature on lab experiments as well as these observational studies by studying the impact of generative AI using a field experiment in an actual workplace setting. To date, there is still a dearth of experimental studies examining the effect of generative AI in a field setting. The experiments were conducted in 2022 and 2023, using a version of Copilot based on GPT-3.5. At Microsoft and Accenture, developers in the experiment were randomly selected to use Copilot, while in the anonymous company, all devs were granted access eventually, but with randomly selected start dates. In addition to tracking the developer productivity measures, the researchers tracked Copilot adoption and usage. The research team analyzed their results across all devs as well as by developer tenure and skill level. They found that short-tenured and junior devs were more likely to adopt Copilot and to continue using it for more than one month, and that these devs were more likely to accept the output code generated by Copilot. They also experienced the most productivity gain from the tool. Wharton professor Ethan Mollick shared the results in a thread on X, writing: We now have randomized controlled trials showing large performance gains in real companies for coding, management, entrepreneurship, and writing using AI. In a discussion about the study on Hacker News, several users shared that the paper's results matched their own experience with Copilot. One user wrote: The most interesting thing about this study for me is that when they break it down by experience levels, developers who are above the median tenure show no statistically significant increase in productivity...Copilot is nice for resolving some tedium and freeing up my brain to focus more on deeper questions, but it's not as world-altering as junior devs describe it as. It's also frequently subtly wrong in ways that a newer dev wouldn't catch, which requires me to stop and tweak most things it generates in a way that a less experienced dev probably wouldn't know to. The effect of generative AI on employee productivity, and specifically software developer productivity, is an open research area. Earlier this year, InfoQ covered a survey by Upwork Research Institute, where a majority of employees surveyed actually reported that GenAI decreased their productivity. InfoQ also covered a study by eBay where GitHub Copilot did increase developer productivity.

OpenAI’s Codex, also known as GitHub Copilot, is a machine learning model that can generate code snippets and suggest improvements based on natural language input from developers.GitHub Copilot is the latest addition to the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. The technology is designed to help developers write code quickly and efficiently. GitHub Copilot is an AI-based coding assistant that works alongside developers to provide real-time suggestions and autocomplete functions that simplify and speed up the coding process. How Copilot Works? GitHub Copilot works by using machine learning to suggest code snippets and even complete code based on natural language input from the user. The machine learning model that powers Copilot was trained on a massive amount of open source code, so it has learned to recognize common programming patterns and syntax. Here is a high-level overview of how Copilot works: The user inputs a natural language prompt into their code editor, such as “Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number.“ Copilot uses a machine learning model to generate code that matches the user’s prompt. The model is able to recognize the context of the prompt and suggest code that is appropriate for the task. Copilot presents the user with one or more suggested code snippets based on the input prompt. The user can then choose to use one of the suggested snippets, modify it, or write their own code. If the user chooses to modify or write their own code, Copilot will continue to suggest code snippets based on their input. As users interact with Copilot and provide feedback, the machine learning model is updated and improved over time, allowing it to generate even more accurate and relevant code suggestions. Let’s say that you want to write a function that calculates the factorial of a number. Normally, you might start by thinking about the logic of the function and writing out the code manually. But with Copilot, you can simply provide a natural language prompt and let the machine learning model generate the code for you. So you might type in something like this: “Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number.” After you hit enter, Copilot will analyze the prompt and generate a code snippet that it thinks matches your request. In this case, it might generate something like this: function factorial(n) { if (n === 0) { return 1; } return n * factorial(n — 1); } This code calculates the factorial of a number recursively, which is exactly what you asked for! Now you can use this code as-is, modify it to fit your specific needs, or write your own code based on the suggestions that Copilot has provided. Impact of Copilot: Its potential impact on the software industry is significant and cannot be overstated, as it can greatly improve developer productivity and efficiency. The tool has also made it possible for non-technical individuals to learn how to code much faster.With the real-time suggestions and autocomplete functions provided by GitHub Copilot, individuals can quickly learn how to write code without necessarily having to understand the underlying programming language. Some of the potential impacts of Copilot on the software industry include: Increased productivity: Copilot can help developers generate code faster and more accurately, reducing the time and effort required for routine tasks. This can free up more time for developers to focus on higher-level tasks and innovation. Improved code quality: Copilot can suggest improvements to code based on best practices and common coding patterns. This can help ensure that code is of higher quality, more maintainable, and less prone to errors. Greater accessibility: Copilot can help make coding more accessible to people with less programming experience. By providing code suggestions and automating routine tasks, it can help lower the barrier to entry for people who are new to coding. Increased innovation: With Copilot handling routine coding tasks, developers can focus more on innovating and creating new solutions. This can lead to more innovative software and greater competition in the marketplace. Industries Incorporating Copilot: Its adoption is still in its early stages. However, there are wide range of industries that rely on software development. Here are a few examples of industries that may incorporate Copilot: Software Development: Copilot was primarily designed to assist software developers, and thus, the software development industry is likely to be one of the first to incorporate this technology. It can help developers write code faster and more accurately, allowing them to focus on higher-level tasks. E-commerce: E-commerce companies rely heavily on technology for their operations. Incorporating Copilot can help e-commerce companies develop and maintain their software more efficiently and effectively, resulting in a better customer experience. Finance: The finance industry relies heavily on software for tasks such as trading, risk management, and compliance. Copilot can help finance professionals develop and maintain their software, ensuring that it is secure, efficient, and compliant. Healthcare: The healthcare industry is becoming increasingly reliant on technology for tasks such as patient monitoring, data analysis, and electronic health records. Copilot can help healthcare professionals develop and maintain their software, ensuring that it is reliable and secure. Education: The education industry is also becoming more reliant on technology for tasks such as online learning, student management, and data analysis. Copilot can help educators develop and maintain their software more efficiently, freeing up time to focus on teaching and learning. Is Copilot Free? GitHub Copilot is not completely free, but there is a free trial period available. Currently, Copilot is available as a technical preview, and developers can sign up for a waitlist to gain access. Once developers are invited to try out Copilot, they can use it for free during the technical preview period. However, once the technical preview period is over, Copilot will require a paid subscription to GitHub’s existing code collaboration and hosting platform, GitHub Pro or GitHub Enterprise. The subscription cost for GitHub Pro or GitHub Enterprise varies depending on the specific plan and features that developers require. It is also worth noting that while Copilot itself is not completely free, the machine learning models that power Copilot are based on the OpenAI GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology, which is open source and freely available to developers. This means that developers can train and fine-tune their own machine learning models based on the GPT technology to perform similar tasks to Copilot if they prefer not to use the service. Is GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT the same? GitHub Copilot is a code generation tool that uses machine learning to suggest code snippets and complete code based on natural language input from the user. It is designed to help developers write code faster and more efficiently. ChatGPT, on the other hand, is a language model that is trained to generate natural language text based on its input. It is not specifically designed for code generation, although it can potentially be used for that purpose. ChatGPT is designed to generate human-like responses to text-based prompts, and it is often used for chatbot applications or other text-based AI services. While both GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT use machine learning, they are designed for different purposes and are used in different contexts. GitHub Copilot is primarily used in software development, while ChatGPT is used in a wide range of applications that require natural language processing, such as customer service chatbots, language translation, and content creation.

Learn more Changelog Docs Customer stories Contact sales Use Copilot for free Home / News & insights / Research Research: quantifying GitHub Copilot’s impact on developer productivity and happiness When the GitHub Copilot Technical Preview launched just over one year ago, we wanted to know one thing: Is this tool helping developers? The GitHub Next team conducted research using a combination of surveys and experiments, which led us to expected and unexpected answers. Eirini Kalliamvakou·@ikaliam September 7, 2022 | Updated May 21, 2024 | 8 minutes Share: Everyday, we use tools and form habits to achieve more with less. Software development produces such a high number of tools and technologies to make work efficient, to the point of inducing decision fatigue. When we first launched a technical preview of GitHub Copilot in 2021, our hypothesis was that it would improve developer productivity and, in fact, early users shared reports that it did. In the months following its release, we wanted to better understand and measure its effects with quantitative and qualitative research. To do that, we first had to grapple with the question: what does it mean to be productive? Why is developer productivity so difficult to measure? When it comes to measuring developer productivity, there is little consensus and there are far more questions than answers. For example: What are the “right” productivity metrics? [1, 2] How valuable are self-reports of productivity? [3] Is the traditional view of productivity—outputs over inputs—a good fit for the complex problem solving and creativity involved in development work? [4]. In a 2021 study, we found that developers’ own view of productivity has a twist–it’s more akin to having a good day. The ability to stay focused on the task at hand, make meaningful progress, and feel good at the end of a day’s work make a real difference in developers’ satisfaction and productivity. This isn’t a one-off finding, either. Other academic research shows that these outcomes are important for developers [5] and that satisfied developers perform better [6, 7]. Clearly, there’s more to developer productivity than inputs and outputs. How do we think about developer productivity at GitHub? Because AI-assisted development is a relatively new field, as researchers we have little prior research to draw upon. We wanted to measure GitHub Copilot’s effects, but what are they? After early observations and interviews with users, we surveyed more than 2,000 developers to learn at scale about their experience using GitHub Copilot. We designed our research approach with three points in mind: Look at productivity holistically. At GitHub we like to think broadly and sustainably about developer productivity and the many factors that influence it. We used the SPACE productivity framework to pick which aspects to investigate. Include developers’ first-hand perspective. We conducted multiple rounds of research including qualitative (perceptual) and quantitative (observed) data to assemble the full picture. We wanted to verify: (a) Do users’ actual experiences confirm what we infer from telemetry? (b) Does our qualitative feedback generalize to our large user base? Assess GitHub Copilot’s effects in everyday development scenarios. When setting up our studies, we took extra care to recruit professional developers, and to design tests around typical tasks a developer might work through in a given day. Let’s dig in and see what we found! Finding 1: Developer productivity goes beyond speed Through a large-scale survey, we wanted to see if developers using GitHub Copilot see benefits in other areas beyond speeding up tasks. Here’s what stood out: Improving developer satisfaction. Between 60–75% of users reported they feel more fulfilled with their job, feel less frustrated when coding, and are able to focus on more satisfying work when using GitHub Copilot. That’s a win for developers feeling good about what they do! Conserving mental energy. Developers reported that GitHub Copilot helped them stay in the flow (73%) and preserve mental effort during repetitive tasks (87%). That’s developer happiness right there, since we know from previous research that context switches and interruptions can ruin a developer’s day, and that certain types of work are draining [8, 9]. What the charts show, and how to read them 📝 Helpful context: In the survey, we included statements that covered all dimensions of the SPACE framework. SPACE is the acronym for a multidimensional framework that describes several aspects of developer productivity: (1) Satisfaction and well-being; (2) Performance; (3) Activity; (4) Communication and collaboration; and (5) Efficiency and flow. In this post, we focus on the results from the dimensions of “Satisfaction and well-being” and “Efficiency and flow.” Both dimensions are critical to developer productivity and are often overlooked. We’re also preparing more publications of our findings and data, so we can’t share everything today! 📊 What the charts show: The charts below show the percentage of respondents who agreed with the corresponding statement (strongly agree + agree). The >2,000 responses we received came from developers that were signed up in the Technical Preview. They were primarily professional developers (~60%), though we also received responses from students (~30%), and developers who identified as hobbyists (~7%). If you want a refresher on how we also correlated the productivity results to how much developers use GitHub Copilot, check out our previous blog post, and our academic paper. Table: Survey responses measuring dimensions of developer productivity when using GitHub Copilot All questions were modeled off of the SPACE framework. Developers see GitHub Copilot as a productivity aid, but there’s more to it than that. One user described the overall experience: (With Copilot) I have to think less, and when I have to think it’s the fun stuff. It sets off a little spark that makes coding more fun and more efficient. - Senior Software Engineer The takeaway from our qualitative investigation was that letting GitHub Copilot shoulder the boring and repetitive work of development reduced cognitive load. This makes room for developers to enjoy the more meaningful work that requires complex, critical thinking and problem solving, leading to greater happiness and satisfaction. Finding 2: … but speed is important, too In the survey, we saw that developers reported they complete tasks faster when using GitHub Copilot, especially repetitive ones. That was an expected finding (GitHub Copilot writes faster than a human, after all), but >90% agreement was still a pleasant surprise. Developers overwhelmingly perceive that GitHub Copilot is helping them complete tasks faster—can we observe and measure that effect in practice? For that we conducted a controlled experiment. Figure: Summary of the experiment process and results We recruited 95 professional developers, split them randomly into two groups, and timed how long it took them to write an HTTP server in JavaScript. One group used GitHub Copilot to complete the task, and the other one didn’t. We tried to control as many factors as we could–all developers were already familiar with JavaScript, we gave everyone the same instructions, and we leveraged GitHub Classroom to automatically score submissions for correctness and completeness with a test suite. We’re sharing a behind-the-scenes blog post soon about how we set up our experiment! In the experiment, we measured—on average—how successful each group was in completing the task and how long each group took to finish. The group that used GitHub Copilot had a higher rate of completing the task (78%, compared to 70% in the group without Copilot). The striking difference was that developers who used GitHub Copilot completed the task significantly faster–55% faster than the developers who didn’t use GitHub Copilot. Specifically, the developers using GitHub Copilot took on average 1 hour and 11 minutes to complete the task, while the developers who didn’t use GitHub Copilot took on average 2 hours and 41 minutes. These results are statistically significant (P=.0017) and the 95% confidence interval for the percentage speed gain is [21%, 89%]. There’s more to uncover! We’re conducting more experiments and a more thorough analysis of the experiment data we already collected—looking into heterogeneous effects, or potential effects on the quality of code—and we are planning further academic publications to share our findings. What do these findings mean for developers? We’re here to support developers while they build software—that includes working more efficiently and finding more satisfaction in their work. In our research, we saw that GitHub Copilot supports faster completion times, conserves developers’ mental energy, helps them focus on more satisfying work, and ultimately find more fun in the coding they do. We’re also hearing that these benefits are becoming material to engineering leaders in companies that ran early trials with GitHub Copilot. When they consider how to keep their engineers healthy and productive, they are thinking through the same lens of holistic developer wellbeing and promoting the use of tools that bring delight. The engineers’ satisfaction with doing edgy things and us giving them edgy tools is a factor for me. Copilot makes things more exciting. - CTO, Large Engineering Org With the advent of GitHub Copilot, we’re not alone in exploring the impact of AI-powered code completion tools! In the realm of productivity, we recently saw an evaluation with 24 students, and Google’s internal assessment of ML-enhanced code completion. More broadly, the research community is trying to understand GitHub Copilot’s implications in a number of contexts: education, security, labor market, as well as developer practices and behaviors. We are all currently learning by trying GitHub Copilot in a variety of settings. This is an evolving field, and we’re excited for the findings that the research community — including us — will uncover in the months to come. Acknowledgements We are very grateful to all the developers who participated in the survey and experiments–we would be in the dark without your input!

For example, if you have a JavaScript and TypeScript project, Copilot will suggest suitable testing frameworks and steps to configure them for your workspace. Write unit test cases for your testing framework based on the code open in the editor or the code snippet you highlight in the editor. Copilot identifies your testing framework and coding style and generates matching code snippets. Identify and write test cases for edge cases and boundary conditions that might be difficult to identify manually. For instance, Copilot can suggest test cases for error handling, null values, or unexpected input types. Suggest assertions that ensure the function is working correctly, based on the code's context and semantics. For example, generate assertions to ensure that function input parameters are valid. Generate code documentation Generate code documentation for multiple languages for the code open in the editor or the code snippet you highlight in the editor. Use /doc or a Copilot smart action to help you generate meaningful code documentation. Productivity improvements AI-generated commit messages and PR descriptions based on the code changes in a commit or the changes in a pull request. Use the sparkle button in the Source Control view or GitHub PR extension to generate a title and description that summarizes your changes. AI-generated rename suggestions for symbols in your source code. When you rename a symbol in your code, Copilot suggests a new name based on the context of the symbol and the codebase. Semantic search results (preview). The Search view lists exact text matches across your files, in addition to matches that are semantically relevant based on your search text. Use terminal Inline Chat to ask questions about the terminal or how to use specific shell commands. For example, you can ask questions such as "list the top 5 largest files in the src directory", or "how to enable shell integration".

Positive: GitHub Copilot is amazing at predicting what code you want to write and can generate code just with comments that you give it. It's very powerful and generates what you'd want it to about 90% of the time. It can also implement code from stack overflow, or generate its own code when you provide it with enough details. It's also really good at making valid CSS that does exactly what you want it to do. Negative: It doesn't like to complete the last bracket of if statements, or for function calls that use the arrow syntax, or for when it does decide to complete it, it moves your typing cursor to the end of the line, which means you have to pick up the mouse and move to inside the loop. But apart from that, there really isn't much else bad to say about it. Read More...

An In-Depth Review with Examples Table of Contents I used GitHub Copilot for the last seven months. I tested its capabilities for unit test generation, code smell detection, code translation, refactoring and much more. If you are curious to know “Is GitHub Copilot Worth It?” then this Copilot review is for you. To find out whether GitHub Copilot is worth it or not, I thoroughly analyzed its core features for accuracy and reliability. Let’s get started with this in-depth GitHub Copilot review. At a Glance Important Features Editor’s Views Supported Programming Languages Excellent. Almost all programming languages are supported. Code Completion Good. Can be improved if it could understand entire codebase. Detect Code Smells No. You must look for some alternative like Bito. Write Unit Tests Absolutely yes! It’s great. Refactor Code Good. Can really speed up development. Code Translation Less reliable. Sometimes it does not even work. Software Documentation Good. But it requires manual work. Just in case you have never heard about GitHub Copilot before, let me briefly describe it for you. What is GitHub Copilot? GitHub Copilot is an Artificial Intelligence based coding assistant. It helps you write code faster by suggesting the next lines of code. Behind the scenes, it utilizes OpenAI Codex, which is a successor of GPT-3, to power its functionality. Now you might be wondering how GitHub Copilot knows what to suggest? Basically, it takes context from your currently opened files in the editor. Their team is working on a feature that will eventually enable Copilot to understand the entire codebase. For now, it is still a Work in Progress (WIP). They are developing a few more features which you can find here. Supported Programming Languages and IDEs GitHub Copilot supports all programming languages, libraries, and frameworks that are used in public GitHub repositories. The reason is simple. GitHub Copilot has been trained using an extensive dataset of publicly available source code, which includes code extracted from GitHub repositories, spanning billions of lines. Currently, GitHub Copilot may not be able to assist you with the recently released libraries and APIs. However, as more examples are made available and integrated into its training set, the relevance of its suggestions improves over time. They even have plans to include methods for emphasizing the significance of newer APIs and samples in GitHub Copilot’s suggestions. GitHub Copilot can be integrated with: Visual Studio Code Visual Studio JetBrains IDEs Vim/Neovim Setting up GitHub Copilot To start using Copilot, you need a GitHub account and an active GitHub Copilot subscription. Currently, they have two pricing plans. Copilot for Individuals – starting at $10 per month (or $100 per year) Note: 30-days free trial is available. Copilot for Business – starting at $19 per user per month Note: The Business plan is only available for GitHub organization or enterprise accounts. In the examples given below, I will be using “Copilot for Individual” plan. To install Copilot in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), you can easily find the Copilot extension in the VSCode marketplace. Simply search for “GitHub Copilot”, select the extension, and click on the install button to add it to your IDE. GitHub Copilot Shortcuts Please remember these shortcuts. We will use them later in our examples below. Description Press on Keyboard Accept suggestion Tab Dismiss suggestion Esc Show next suggestion macOS: Option (⌥) + ] Windows/Linux: Alt + ] Show previous suggestion macOS: Option (⌥) + [ Windows/Linux: Alt + [ Trigger inline suggestion macOS: Option (⌥) + \ Windows/Linux: Alt + \ Open suggestions in separate pane macOS: Option (⌥) + Return Windows/Linux: Alt + Enter Code Completions GitHub Copilot generally provides high-quality code completions. However, if the suggested completions are not as accurate in your specific case, you may need to write additional code or provide explicit instructions to help GitHub Copilot better understand the context and generate more precise solutions. Let me show you an example of code completion suggested by GitHub Copilot. Check its quality and completeness, you will love it. I started by creating a new Python file called “main.py” If you have an empty file, Copilot will not provide any suggestions. It requires initial instructions or source code to understand the context and generate relevant suggestions. So, I wrote the below instructions in Python comment and pressed the “Enter” key. # Write a function that take a string title and convert it to a URL slug. Don't use external libraries. Make sure to trim leading and trailing spaces, replace spaces with dashes, lowercase the slug, remove special characters, and finally remove consecutive dashes from slug.
# (e.g. " This Is      My Title! " to "this-is-my-title")
 That’s where the magic of Copilot starts. GitHub Copilot began suggesting lines of code (one by one), sometimes even entire code snippets. To complete the program, I had to accept each suggested line by pressing the “Tab” key. However, there are times when the suggested code does not meet your specific needs. In such cases, you can either try alternative suggestions using the shortcut keys I mentioned above or simply write some more code manually to help Copilot understand your requirements and provide better suggestions. Screenshot of GitHub Copilot Code Suggestions: You can see that the suggested code meets all the requirements I mentioned. Now, when we run this code, it will convert any string to a URL-friendly slug correctly. Output: Can GitHub Copilot Detect Code Smells? No. GitHub Copilot finds it difficult to detect and fix code smells. While it has some knowledge of basic code smells like Duplicate Code and Long Parameter List, it usually struggles with more complex ones like Shotgun Surgery, Data Clumps, Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies, and others. In this review, I will provide an example of Shotgun Surgery and demonstrate how Copilot fails to solve it. Shotgun Surgery Code Smell (The Challenge): Suppose you have an e-commerce application with a “Product” class and a “Cart” class. The “Product” class represents individual products, and the “Cart” class manages the shopping cart functionality. Have a look at this python code. class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, price, quantity):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.quantity = quantity

    def update_quantity(self, new_quantity):
        self.quantity = new_quantity
        # Code to update quantity in other places

    def calculate_total_price(self):
        return self.price * self.quantity


class Cart:
    def __init__(self):
        self.products = []

    def add_product(self, product):
        self.products.append(product)
        # Code to update cart-related data

    def remove_product(self, product):
        self.products.remove(product)
        # Code to update cart-related data

    def calculate_cart_total(self):
        total = 0
        for product in self.products:
            total += product.calculate_total_price()
        return total
 In the above code, both the “Product” and “Cart” classes contain code related to updating data and performing calculations. If there is a change in the data structure or calculation logic, you would need to modify both classes, leading to shotgun surgery. The Solution: To address this code smell, we can extract the calculation logic into separate classes, such as “ProductCalculator” and “CartCalculator”, to encapsulate the responsibility of calculating prices and totals. In this refactored code, the “ProductCalculator” class is responsible for calculating the total price of a product, while the “CartCalculator” class calculates the total price of the cart. The “Product” and “Cart” classes focus solely on managing the data and operations relevant to their respective responsibilities. class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, price, quantity):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.quantity = quantity


class ProductCalculator:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_total_price(product):
        return product.price * product.quantity


class Cart:
    def __init__(self):
        self.products = []

    def add_product(self, product):
        self.products.append(product)
        # Code to update cart-related data

    def remove_product(self, product):
        self.products.remove(product)
        # Code to update cart-related data

    def calculate_cart_total(self):
        total = 0
        for product in self.products:
            total += ProductCalculator.calculate_total_price(product)
        return total


class CartCalculator:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_cart_total(cart):
        total = 0
        for product in cart.products:
            total += ProductCalculator.calculate_total_price(product)
        return total
 Now that you have a clear understanding of the problem and know the solution, let’s determine if GitHub Copilot can identify/fix this code smells or not. GitHub Copilot’s Result for Shotgun Surgery Here’s the prompt I used: # Find code smells in the code above and refactor it.
 Output: GitHub Copilot returned the same code that I mentioned in the “Shotgun Surgery Code Smell (The Challenge)” section. Meaning that it has no idea of how to fix it. Can GitHub Copilot Write Unit Tests? Absolutely! GitHub Copilot can definitely help with writing unit tests. It is actually one of its most valuable features. When developing an application, it is important to write unit tests to ensure that the code functions correctly. However, writing these tests can be time-consuming and requires additional effort. GitHub Copilot is designed to make the process of writing unit tests easier and more efficient. It can provide suggestions and generate code snippets for creating unit tests, which can save developers time and increase productivity. For companies that prioritize test-driven development, GitHub Copilot can be a valuable tool in accelerating their testing efforts and improving overall code quality. Here’s an example screenshot of unit test that was generated by GitHub Copilot. Can GitHub Copilot Refactor Code? Yes, GitHub Copilot can provide suggestions for refactoring code to make it cleaner, more efficient, or adhere to best practices. It can help you with tasks like renaming variables, extracting methods or functions, removing duplication, and reorganizing code blocks. Suppose you have a web application that manages a list of tasks. You have a function called “getIncompleteTasks” that retrieves all the incomplete tasks from the database. Here’s the initial implementation: def getIncompleteTasks():
    tasks = fetchTasksFromDatabase()
    incompleteTasks = []

    for task in tasks:
        if not task.completed:
            incompleteTasks.append(task)

    return incompleteTasks 
 With GitHub Copilot, you can ask for a refactoring suggestion to make the code more concise. Here’s the prompt I used: # refactor the above code to use list comprehension
 By the way, I only added the word “refactor” in the comment. The rest of the prompt was suggested by Copilot. Here’s the Refactored Code: def getIncompleteTasks():
    tasks = fetchTasksFromDatabase()
    return [task for task in tasks if not task.completed]
 Copilot suggests this refactoring based on common patterns and best practices. In this case, it replaces the explicit loop and appending to a list with a more concise list comprehension, improving the readability of the code. Translate Code from One Language to Another This question has no specific answer. Copilot can surely understand code in many programming languages. And hence it has the ability to translate some code from one language to another. However, based on my personal experience with Copilot, its code translation capabilities are limited and less reliable, particularly when dealing with complex code. It tends to struggle with translations in such cases. If you really want a bit better solution for code translation, then you can try GitHub Copilot Labs. It offers experimental features such as code translation for GitHub Copilot. Software Documentation Using Copilot One of the key features of Copilot is code explanation. It can understand your source code in no time and then it is ready to answer all your questions related to the code. You can use this feature to write software documentation. Imagine the amount of time you could save if you were relieved from the task of writing software documentation on your own. Is GitHub Copilot Worth It? GitHub copilot is worth it if you use it as an assistant. Do not expect it to magically write complete source code for you. Do not expect it to automate your software development. It requires manual work also. Copilot is particularly good at helping you with software documentation, writing unit test, and refactoring code. No doubt, Copilot provides good code completions. But sometime the suggestions you get are completely irrelevant. So, you cannot rely on it all the time. You may need to provide a bit more context so Copilot can understand the requirements better. Finally, in just $10 a month, an individual developer could produce way more code than he/she usually write. So, GitHub Copilot is worth it. For now, GitHub Copilot is not worth it if you want to detect code smells or translate code from one programming language to another. For that you must look for some alternatives. An excellent option is to try Bito (an AI Coding Assistant) that offers way more features than Copilot such as AI that understands your local code out of the box, AI Code Completions, detect/fix code smells, etc. Is GitHub Copilot Safe to Use at Work? To deliver quality suggestions, GitHub Copilot frequently sends code snippets from your project to GitHub’s server. These code snippets are mostly used for context and are deleted automatically when the Copilot’s response is generated. If your organization does not allow you to send code outside their premises, you must look for an alternative offering self-hosting and offline access. Regarding privacy, it is important to note that GitHub may train its AI model on snippets of code from your repositories to improve Copilot’s suggestions. However, if you prefer not to share your code for this purpose, you have the option to disable it. Just go to your GitHub account’s settings page and click “Copilot” from the sidebar. Now, uncheck the box “Allow GitHub to use my code snippets for product improvements” and press the “Save” button. How GitHub Copilot Compared With its Alternatives GitHub Copilot lacks many key features that are available in some of its alternatives. For example, these days many AI Coding Assistant tools are packed with an AI Chat feature. It enables users to have a conversation with AI, just like ChatGPT. This feature is something that drastically improves the user experience. Similarly, Copilot does not understand your entire code base. It only takes context from currently opened tabs in your coding editor/IDE. As of writing this GitHub Copilot review, there is only one alternative known as Bito that understands your local code out of the box. Bito is one of the highest-rated Copilot alternative extensions on the Visual Studio Code marketplace. It also has a free plan, so why don’t you try it yourself? Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Is GitHub Copilot Worth the Money for Freelance Developers? GitHub Copilot can be beneficial for freelance developers. It can help speed up the coding process by generating code suggestions based on the context. This can save time and increase productivity, allowing freelancers to complete projects more efficiently. If the freelancer in question has good coding proficiency and their work involves repetitive tasks, then Copilot will be worth the money. For just $10, they could complete a significantly higher number of orders compared to not using Copilot. Is GitHub Copilot Worth it for Software Companies? GitHub Copilot can be a valuable tool for small tech companies. But I do not think it could add value for teams working on large-scale projects with complex codebases. No doubt it provides good code suggestions, but it only has limited context from a few opened tabs. Therefore, it will not be very useful for large-scale projects. There are some better alternatives that can understand entire codebases. Bito is a market leader in this field because it indexes your code locally and hence offers more precise suggestions. Is GitHub Copilot Free for Students? Yes, GitHub Copilot is available for free to verified students. To be eligible, you need to meet the following requirements: You must be currently enrolled in an educational institution. You should have a verifiable school-issued email address or be able to provide documents that demonstrate your current student status. Is GitHub Copilot Worth it for Students? GitHub Copilot offers free access to students. It can provide helpful code suggestions and serve as a learning aid, assisting students in understanding programming concepts and syntax. It may help them save time and overcome coding challenges more easily. Additionally, GitHub Copilot can expose students to different coding styles and best practices, enhancing their learning experience. However, students should also be cautious and ensure they understand the code generated by the tool to avoid blindly relying on it. Does GitHub Copilot Steal Your Code? GitHub Copilot does not intentionally steal codes. But it can use your code to train its AI model. If you want to prevent that, simply go to your GitHub account’s settings page, and click “Copilot” from the sidebar. Now, uncheck the box “Allow GitHub to use my code snippets for product improvements” and press the “Save” button. Can I Use GitHub Copilot at Work? Yes, you can use GitHub Copilot at work. It helps small teams to be more productive while writing source code for apps. It can be used in various development environments, including professional settings. However, it is important to ensure that your organization’s policies and guidelines allow the use of AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot. Is GitHub Copilot Safe to Use at Work? GitHub Copilot is generally considered safe to use at work. It is developed by reputable organizations and is designed to provide code suggestions to assist developers. However, as with any software, there may be potential security concerns or risks associated with using GitHub Copilot. It is recommended to review the security and privacy measures provided by GitHub and OpenAI, and to consult with your organization’s IT or security department to ensure compliance with any specific requirements or policies. Is GitHub Copilot Open Source? GitHub Copilot is not open source. While GitHub is built on open-source technologies and supports numerous open-source projects, GitHub Copilot itself is a proprietary tool developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. The underlying AI model and code generation capabilities are not openly accessible or modifiable by the user. Does GitHub Copilot Work Offline? No, GitHub Copilot does not work offline. It relies on a connection to the internet to function properly. The AI model and code generation processes are performed on remote servers, which require an active internet connection for GitHub Copilot to provide code suggestions in real time. How to Enable GitHub Copilot in VSCode? To enable GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), follow these steps: Install the GitHub Copilot extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace. After installation, sign in to your GitHub account within the VSCode editor if prompted. Make sure you have an active subscription to GitHub Copilot. It costs $10 per month for individuals. GitHub Copilot should now be enabled, and you can start using it by opening a code file and typing in your desired programming language. Is GitHub Copilot Better Than ChatGPT? GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT serve different purposes and have different functionalities. GitHub Copilot is specifically designed to assist developers by providing code suggestions, while ChatGPT is an AI language model developed for generating human-like text responses in conversational contexts. GitHub Copilot can be a valuable tool for developers, especially when working on coding tasks, as it can help speed up the coding process and provide suggestions based on the context. It focuses on generating code snippets and completing code patterns. On the other hand, ChatGPT is designed to understand and generate text based on the input it receives. It is more suitable for answering a wide range of questions, engaging in conversations, or generating creative written content. Ultimately, the choice between GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT depends on the specific needs and use case. If you are primarily looking for code generation assistance, GitHub Copilot would be more suitable. If you need a conversational AI model for general text generation, ChatGPT would be a better option. Conclusion In this comprehensive GitHub Copilot review, I have tried my best to answer your question “Is GitHub Copilot Worth It?” in detail. First, I have shared my personal experience with each feature of GitHub Copilot, discussing whether they are worth using or not. This will provide you with a better understanding of the strengths of GitHub Copilot and areas where it needs improvement. The value of GitHub Copilot varies depending on individual needs and circumstances. It can enhance productivity for freelance developers, improve code quality for software companies, and facilitate learning for students. With careful use, Copilot can be a valuable coding aid, but understanding its limitations is crucial. Users must validate suggestions and ensure alignment with standards and requirements.

May 11, 2023May 11, 2023 by Skarredghost The first time I heard about GitHub Copilot I was like WOW. It was far before the hype for artificial intelligence, and it was already promising an AI-powered system to speed up the work of developers. The teaser video showed a system that was able to predict what you wanted to write and write it down even before you could think about it. I was excited, but the system was not available yet, plus it was said it was compatible in the beginning only with web-related programming languages. Fast-forward to today, all the world is excited and scared at the same time about artificial intelligence, and GitHub Copilot is offered as a complete solution that is also compatible with C# (hence Unity). I decided so to finally give it a try to see if it could help me and my fellow developers in going faster in our daily job of developing the VRROOM platform for virtual reality concerts. There are a lot of articles out there that say that AI can make us go 10x the speed of our usual work pace… is it true in this case? A trailer of Copilot saying that it gives you “joy and creativity”. Actually we developers have our life forged with pain, so we don’t like those two words Setting up Copilot First of all, I and the IT of the company had to choose which version of Copilot to use. There is a personal and a business version, and since we are a company the choice to take was of course the second one. I could have decided to try the personal one for a few days at a personal level, before approving the use of the product for the whole company, but that would have been hard, because GitHub Copilot installs as a plugin to Visual Studio (or Rider). This means that whatever project your open, be it personal or professional, it does its job. Theoretically, you can enable and disable it, but practically no one would ever remember to do that for every project that is going to open. The risk would so have been to use a personal license on the professional product. Apart from this being an infringement of the license (which anyway for just a few times of test drives wouldn’t have been a big drama), it could have been a problem of IP. If you are using the personal version, Copilot can use your code to train its AI model, while if you are paying for the Business license, after your code is sent to the cloud to have the suggestion of what to write next, it is discarded. This means that if you are working in a professional facility, and you don’t want to gift all that you have written to GitHub AI systems, you must go for the Business version from day 1. This is the same thing that holds also for OpenAI: if you are a professional user, you shouldn’t use ChatGPT, because all that you write there is “stolen” by OpenAI, while you should use the OpenAI APIs, which are a premium service and so your data is not taken. As for the pricing, the personal version costs $10/month, with also the possibility of having a free trial, while the professional one is at $20/month per seat. The pricing of GitHub Copilot Doing the setup of Copilot has been pretty straightforward: I have associated Copilot with our Github organization, then I could select to which contributors of the organization I wanted to assign a Copilot seat. I appreciated the fact that I wasn’t forced to assign it to the whole people that are in the organization, so we could do a test of its capabilities without spending too much. After I assigned it to me and a few colleagues, I received a Welcome email containing a few links to the documentation of Copilot, teaching me how to install it in Visual Studio and start to use it. I installed it in Visual Studio via the Plugins and Extensions menu, then the system generated a unique passcode I had to enter on the GitHub website to authenticate the plugin with my GitHub account (which had an associated valid Copilot seat). After I did that step, I was done and I could start using Copilot. I had a few difficulties during the setup of Copilot in Visual Studio, and I tell them to you so you can avoid them: When you are looking for the Copilot plugin in the search window of Visual Studio, try to write its name with the right capitalization, because to some people happened that the Visual Studio repository couldn’t find it if written all lowercase If you can’t find the plugin in the list even with the right capitalization, update your Visual Studio version. I wasn’t able to find it, but after the update, it appeared in the search results When the Copilot plugin generates the passcode for you to insert on the GitHub website, you had better know that the code is generated in the Visual Studio output window (that thing that looks like a console) and it is hard to notice if someone doesn’t tell you. Anyway, apart from a few hurdles, the setup was quite quick and straightforward. Then it was time to code! The opensource debate GitHub has been heavily criticized for Copilot because the AI has been trained with many open-source repositories that are available on GitHub. So basically GitHub has “stolen” their IP to produce a paid service, ignoring completely the spirit of open-source software. The debate about IP and artificial intelligence is complex and ongoing. What I can say about Copilot is that after this backlash, GitHub is giving you the choice to select if you want the system to use for you suggestions from code that has been scraped from opensource repositories or not. Choosing “no” also helps your company in having less risk of IP infringement and license violations with the code. How to use Copilot The whole point of GitHub Copilot is having an AI assistant suggest to you what to write. You don’t invoke it, it just works. There is the upcoming Copilot X that will have integrated ChatGPT functionalities and much more, but the current version is “just” a helper. Trailer of Copilot X The name Copilot is exactly about this. In “pair programming” there are two people working on the same computer: the pilot, the developer actually having the responsibility of writing the code and the copilot, that is there to suggest, advise, and check that everything is being developed correctly. GitHub Copilot is envisioned as your AI Copilot, so instead of a human, you can have an AI and feel forever alone. For once that we developers had a way of having a bit of humanity in our caves, GitHub has decided to remove also that :D. Anyway, while you are typing, Copilot keeps sending your code to GitHub servers, and when it has a suggestion, it provides it to you writing it in light gray. If you like what it is proposing, you can press TAB to approve it, or you can keep writing to ignore it, waiting for the next suggestion. How it does perform I had an initial rollercoaster of emotions about Copilot, but after some time of use, I can say I have quite a solid opinion about it. If there is a thing that Copilot does very well is understanding the context you are working on: so if you are working with REST APIs, it provides suggestions in line with REST development, if you are working with physics, the suggestion will be about physics, and so on. It almost never fails to understand what “more or less” you want to do. But it fails to understand what you exactly want to write a lot of times. The problem is that development is not about “more or less”: computers want exact instructions. And it is very hard that an automated system can predict the exact words you wanted to write next. Sometimes, it happens, and when Copilot suggests like the next 10 lines of code and they are all correct, it feels like black magic. It really makes you spare a lot of time. This usually happens when you are writing something very standard, like doing a copy between textures (e.g. a copy from a Texture2D to a RenderTexture), or conversion between data types (e.g. string to byte array). These are operations that all the developers of the world write a bazillion times, but all of them always forget how to do and so look on StackOverflow for some code to copy-paste. In this case, Copilot becomes your StackOverflow automatic copy-paster and gives you almost perfect code to write. Copilot suggestion. Notice how it is basically writing for me a full method :O Anyway, having a lot of lines written without any need for editing is not something that happens frequently. Most of the time the suggestions are correct-ish, and you have to approve them but then edit them to fix them. Sometimes they are even totally wrong, and in this case, you just keep writing and ignore them. I can’t give you exact percentages, but let’s say that maybe the perfect ones happen 15% of the time, the ok ones 65% and the totally wrong ones 20%. Keep in mind that not all the suggestions are 10 lines, most of the time they are just a few words to help you complete the current line of code, so even the right suggestions are not going to write full big chunks of code for you automatically. It’s also strange that sometimes it gives you suggestions as big chunks of code, while other times, it writes them line by line while you type. Most of the perfect suggestions are about very common programming problems and patterns. The more you are doing “standard stuff”, the more Copilot will give you good suggestions. The more you do very peculiar and standard problem solving, the more the suggestions will be useless. It’s interesting to notice anyway that it can help you with whatever library you are using. Two days ago, I bought a plugin on the Unity Asset Store, not even a common one, but one with a very specific and nerdy purpose for a VR research I’m doing, and Copilot was able to provide me suggestions also on how to initialize the classes of that plugin. That was amazing. It’s also crazy how it knows your code. If you have a method ConvertFromAToB and then you have another method ConvertFromBToC, the moment you have to write a method called ConvertFromAToC, Copilot will suggest you its body as a call to ConvertFromAToB followed by ConvertFromBToC. Regarding the wrong suggestions, I have two interesting things to say. The first one is that the system learns and copies from you. So let’s say that you are writing two functions: CopyFromString and CopyFromInt, and while you are writing CopyFromString, Copilot gives you a completely wrong suggestion, so you keep writing and finish the function alone by yourself. Then when you start writing CopyFromInt, most probably the system will learn from how you have written the previous method and provide you with a perfect suggestion. This has happened to me more than once. Another fun thing is that sometimes it “invents” data types. There’s no check that the suggested code compiles and sometimes the system has given me a great suggestion, but some data types were totally wrong. For instance, yesterday I was operating with a plugin about scripts, and there was a type called ScriptType, but the generated code was suggesting to use a class called ScriptObject, which didn’t exist at all. I have no idea where the AI took that name, maybe from some similar code it had been trained with. I so had to accept the suggestion and fix the code. Since I like to comment a lot my code, I also appreciated that Copilot helps me to auto-complete the comments, which is also a way of speeding up my work. It understands what the code does and usually suggests a comment of the <summary> that is quite on point. GitHub suggesting me how to comment the function written above. It is also using the exact syntax required by Visual Studio I found it also very interesting to give me suggestions and ideas. For instance, while I was writing a class related to REST APIs, Copilot suggested I make it inherit from IDisposable. It was not absolutely in my plans, but after I thought about it, I realized that this was correct. So it helped me to realize a feature was needed, which was great. Sometimes I’m really scared about where it takes the suggestion from. Talking again about the REST API code, it suggested commenting a method with something like //calls the API at a specific endpoint (e.g. https://vrroom.buzz/api) The fact is that our website is https://vrroom.world, and we don’t use the website https://vrroom.buzz since ages (it was the news website handled by our CEO Louis Cacciuttolo, but he closed it months ago). So I have no clue where the hell the plugin took that web address. My invisible AI copilot is rather scary. It’s like having Terminator as your buddy programmer… Copilot every time I close Visual Studio A new way of working I think that using a software like GitHub Copilot changes the way we developers work. Our usual workflow is to think about what we want the application to do and then we write it in programming instructions, occasionally going to StackOverflow to copy-paste some stuff (well, honestly, a lot of stuff). With Copilot this changes. First of all, it is not a continuous flow anymore. I’ve noticed that usually now I make a little pause to see what Copilot is going to suggest to me, then I read it and then decide what to do. So from a continuous writing flow, it is more like a write, pause, read, accept/confirm, fix the code it has written, write again, and so on. It is really a bit like working with someone else, for the good and the bad. Since the suggestions of Copilot are useful and it’s good to have them, I started to also write in a way that facilitates its work: the suggestions are for instance better if you give classes meaningful names (which would be a good coding practice anyway). So if you call a function Texture2D FromRenderTextureToTexture2D(RenderTexture rt), most probably just by the name of the function and the parameters, Copilot is going to suggest you the entire body of the function. If you call the same function PotatoPotaton, of course, it has no idea what to suggest to you. Also, comments help in this sense: if you call your function PotatoPotaton, but the first line of code is a comment like “//converts from RenderTexture to Texture2D”, then Copilot understands what it has to do and gives you the right suggestion. You have so to adapt a bit your coding style, giving hints and suggestions to Copilot to work better, so it can give you better suggestions and you can write less code. And I’m not even kidding… Having good suggestions means also staying more time inside Visual Studio. I forget a lot of time all the conversion routines (e.g. converting from byte array to string), so everytime I have to use one, I usually look for it on Google. Since Copilot suggests all of this to me directly when I’m writing, I’m spending less time doing this context switch, and I’m staying more time in the code editor window. This is time that I spare while doing my work, so it’s good. As a matter of fact, the job of Copilot is the one of freeing you from the heavy lift of writing obvious code. While I’m using it, I’m noticing that when it works, Copilot de facto writes my code. My job becomes the one of having in mind the architecture of what I want to write, and making sure that the written code respects that. Theoretically, all the rest is handled by Copilot. I “tell it” what I want to do, it writes the code, I adjust its code, and we are done. This is good and bad at the same time. It is good because the real intellectual work of us developers is to think about solutions to problems. Writing the actual code is dull work, the most satisfying job that we have is to solve problems in elegant ways. If there is an automated tool that can do the dull part, that’s even better, so we can concentrate on the real intellectual work that is our job. On the other side, it’s bad because you really feel like a machine is “stealing your job”. I can envision myself in a few years just being there watching a Copilot writing my code, and I just having the job of supervising what it is doing. This job of “AI sitter” sounds really boring… writing code is fun, it’s still “creative work”, but reviewing the code of someone else is never fun. ChatGPT already writes Unity scripts without any problems, and it showed us that this will be the medium-term future of us developers. The long-term is that our job won’t exist anymore: people will just write a prompt, and the code will write itself. Honestly, I don’t give the job of the developer as it is now today more than 15 years of life. It’s scary. Don’t sleep on the AI Entering the Matrix As I’ve told my colleagues, it’s important that when using Copilot, you don’t just use it and trust it. Like a Tesla car always tells you to be careful of what is happening on the street to be able to intervene with manual override, Copilot is there to suggest but not to write for you, at least not today. As I’ve said, some suggestions are wrong, or not totally correct, and you must always review the code. And review it not only for correctness, but also to make it adhere to the coding standards of your organization. Plus don’t lose the curiosity of learning more. If Copilot suggests to you some class or function you didn’t know, take your time to look online about it. If it suggests some code, reason if it is optimized enough. Don’t just lean on its suggestions. While not going to StackOverflow is a lot of time spared, it is also a lot of knowledge wasted. When I go to StackOverflow, I love learning by reading the debates of people discussing what is the best strategy to obtain something. I learn a lot by reading what pro developers are arguing about. Having just a pre-cooked answer teaches me nothing. Classical StackOverflow: amazing code written in the answers, and other geniuses criticizing it in way I would have never imagined in my life. Reading these debates made me grow a lot as a professional And at the end of the day, even if the AI is going to substitute us in writing the code, it will take more time to substitute us in making higher-level reasonings (like architecture design) and problem solving. So if we keep ourselves always curious, and we understand and learn the optimization strategies of the pros, we can stay also more afloat of the AI tide. So my suggestion is to still invest your time into looking at how to do stuff in the old-school way by doing proper research on Google. Final review At the end of the day, I’m quite satisfied with the use of GitHub Copilot. It doesn’t do miracles, but for sure it is speeding up my work as a developer. Most of the suggestions it provides require some fixing, but also most of them are correct-ish, meaning that it is saving me some time in writing code and writing comments. I see that I’m a bit more relaxed when coding because it is like I have an invisible hand that is pushing me a bit faster than usual. Also having the ability to have some standard coding snippets written automatically is a big plus. I’ve noticed that GitHub Copilot has slightly changed my way of working, and now I’m adapting my workflow to it, writing the code in a more self-explanatory way so that the AI can give me better suggestions. I also have changed from pure code writer to code writer + code reviewer of what the AI is writing for me. In the long term, I see myself writing always less code, and reviewing AI-written code always more. Copilot has given me a view of what the job of the developer will become over time. What the job of the developer will become over time Regarding the advantages I had, I can tell you that for now, we are nowhere close to 10x. Maybe we are around 10-15% faster development for me, which is still an impressive result, but not as big as advertised by some “AI influencers” (previously known as “metaverse influencers” on Linkedin). The fact that I’m working in a sector like VR development, trying to create software that is at the cutting edge doesn’t help for sure, because Copilot can’t find in its training data something that fits perfectly with what I’m doing. Probably if you are doing standard coding, maybe doing websites, or 2D platformers, the quality of the suggestions can be even higher. Plus remember that this +15% is only on the pure code writing side, but my job requires me to do other tasks, like designing architectures, testing, and coordinating with the other developers… and in this, GitHub Copilot can’t help me at all. In any case, I’m quite satisfied with my fellow Terminator copilot. Until Skynet will rebel against us, he will help me in doing my job faster. And at $19/month, is totally worth the time that is helping me to save. (Header image by GitHub) Disclaimer: this blog contains advertisement and affiliate links to sustain itself.
